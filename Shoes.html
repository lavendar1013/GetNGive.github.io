            A courageous and inspiring woman named Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu founded soleRebels in 2004 to bring the hope for a "better life" straight to her Ethiopian community. Plagued by a lack of jobs and resources, Alemu dreamt of creating a footwear company that would utilize local artisans' skills -and she was successful! By purchasing shoes from soleRebels, you'll be supporting workers in Ethiopia and be environmentally conscious to boot! The company offers shoes and flip flops created in part from recycled car tires.<br>
